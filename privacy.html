  <h1>TamilRadio FM - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-28</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><b>TamilRadio FM</b> is a radio streaming app published by <b>Corneon AI</b>. We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><b>We do not ask for or collect personal information</b> such as your name, phone number, address, contacts, or payment information.</p>

  <p>Depending on how the app is configured, the app may collect limited information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>App activity & performance data</b> (e.g., basic usage events, crash logs, diagnostics, and performance metrics) to improve stability and performance.</li>
    <li><b>Advertising ID</b> (only if ads are enabled) to show and measure ads and reduce irrelevant ad repetition.</li>
    <li><b>Log data</b> (technical information such as device model, OS version, and network type) when the app encounters an error.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain streaming functionality</li>
    <li>To fix crashes, improve performance, and enhance user experience</li>
    <li>To understand feature usage and improve the product</li>
    <li>To display ads (only if ads are enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Radio Streams & Content</h2>
  <p>
    TamilRadio FM provides access to publicly available radio stream links. We do not host or own the radio streams unless explicitly stated.
    Stream availability, audio content, and station metadata are controlled by the respective station providers.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Internet</b>: required to stream radio content</li>
    <li><b>Foreground service / notifications</b> (if enabled): used for audio playback controls and persistent playback while streaming</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, or advertising (only if enabled).
    These services may collect limited information as described above, under their respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Limited data (such as crash logs, diagnostics, and Advertising ID if ads are enabled) may be shared with service providers
    only for operating, improving, and monetizing the app (for example analytics/crash tools and ad networks when enabled).
  </p>

  <h2>7) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep collected data only for as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy (e.g., to improve stability and performance),
    and as required by applicable laws or service provider retention rules.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can uninstall the app at any time to stop further data collection.</li>
    <li>If ads are enabled, you can reset or limit your Advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    TamilRadio FM is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.
